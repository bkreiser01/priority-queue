In addition to this file, please find in this directory the PriorityQueue interface and a test program.  Your assignment is to complete class HeapPriorityQueue which should implement the interface.  Also, you should write and throw appropriate exceptions, as discussed in class.  Submit as attachments your HeapPriorityQueue.java and exception files.  Also, note the following:

1.  Your HeapPriorityQueue class should include the following constructors:
    (A)  a constructor that takes one int argument, which specifies the requested capacity of the heap, 
    (B)  a constructor that takes one array argument, (The elements of the array should become the elements of a newly created heap.  The capacity of the heap should be the same as the number of elements in the array.)
    (C)  a constructor that takes two arguments, an array and a requested capacity.  The elements of the array should become the elements of a newly created heap with capacity as specified by the second argument.
    
2.  Have constructors call other constructors appropriately so as to minimize repeated code.

3.  Do not allow your heap to store null elements.  A NullElementException should be thrown if a user tries to include a null element in the heap.  (You must write the NullElementException class.  It's not built-in.)

4.  The pseudocode from class should be followed as closely as possible.  In particular, you should have buildHeap() and  heapify() in your HeapPriorityQueue class, but they should not be accessible by users of the class.

5.  Use a one-based array.  (Ignore cell zero; just waste the space.)

6.  Recall that you can't create an array of generic (E) type.  However, you can declare the heap variable to be of type E[], create an array of Comparable, and then cast the array to E[] type.  This will cause an unchecked operation compiler warning.  You may ignore it.

7.  Your exceptions may also each cause a compiler warning having to do with serializability.  You may ignore that, too.

8.  Note that the test program does not test everything in the assignment.  In particular, you should write a test program (or modify the one attached) to make sure all the constructors and exceptions work as they should.
